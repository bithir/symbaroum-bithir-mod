These are aimed towards Symbaroum, but idea of this is taken from story cubes.</p><p>At this time, there are four sets of inspirational dice:</p><ul><li><p>Location [dl]</p></li><li><p>Events [de]</p></li><li><p>Creatures [dc]</p></li><li><p>Rewards [dr]</p></li></ul><p>To use them, you can either use the included macro, or just make the roll using the abbreviation, i.e. '/roll 1dl + 2de + 1dc + 3dr' will roll one location dice, two event dice, one creature dice and 3 reward dice.</p><p>There is a macro included, 'Inspiration Roll', which you can decide on how many of each die you can use. It also formats the dice somewhat nicer. See macro list below.</p><p></p><h2>Macros</h2><p>Currently the mod contains 3 macros</p><p><strong>Abomination Generator @UUID[Macro.mNAW5Mrw77dBBlZp]{Abomination Generator}</strong></p><p>Can be used to generate random abominations of different types. It has a small rule engine to generate them, so it is not completely random. See the Bithir's mods <a href=\"https://github.com/bithir/symbaroum-bithir-mod\">github</a> for the code and data that drives it. It generates the Abominations in a folder in the actor catalogue.</p><p>It is important to note that this requires abilities, traits, mystical power and items (weapons/armors) to be imported in to the world. It will only make abominations with abilities that exists in the world.</p><p><strong>Inspirational Roll @UUID[Macro.rDWIgUw0CJh7lfJG]{Inspiration Roll}</strong></p><p>This makes a suitable roll and formats it in a nicer chat message, with elaborations on what each die kinda represents. It also tries (it is subject to lag, so sometimes they will go away anyway) to disable automatic dice fading when dice-so-nice, to make the dice go away, just shake them or make another roll.</p><p><strong>Thus spoke Aroaleta @UUID[Macro.HdMVGkccCHVyrLAC]{Thus spoke Aroaleta}</strong></p><p>This puts a quote of Aroaleta in to the chat window, with reference for story/book and sections. Perhaps nice to let your players see a quote at times, or to give to the barbarian in the party to pull up and recite and times.</p><p></p><h2>Recommended modules to include</h2><ul><li><p>The commercial Symbaroum modules from Free-League</p></li><li><p>Dice-so-nice</p></li></ul><p></p><h2>Credits &amp; Licences</h2><div><div><p><strong>Midjourney</strong> images used from the <a href=\"https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/billing\">\"Non-Paid Members License Terms\"</a>, i.e. Creative Commons Noncommercial 4.0 Attribution International License.</p></div><div><p>Images subject to this license are stored under assets/midjourney</p></div><p><strong>Game-icons</strong> images for the Inspirational dice &amp; DsN dice - <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\">CC BY 3.0</a></p></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"p1fVa688wzxO9LtK":3,"FyXPQ0Hozea7PQri":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.fUtm9137xzMhyNNP"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"symbaroum","systemVersion":"4.0.1","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1664211378657,"modifiedTime":1669473753106,"lastModifiedBy":"EXOzwtPZWRz2Nge1"},"_id":"fUtm9137xzMhyNNP"}],"scenes":[],"tables":[],"macros":[{"name":"Thus spoke Aroaleta","type":"script","scope":"global","author":"FyXPQ0Hozea7PQri","img":"icons/tools/scribal/ink-quill-red.webp","command":"game.bithirmod.macros.thusSpoke();","folder":"keiBTL2WxCWPxGhJ","sort":300000,"ownership":{"default":0,"p1fVa688wzxO9LtK":3,"FyXPQ0Hozea7PQri":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Macro.HdMVGkccCHVyrLAC"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"symbaroum","systemVersion":"4.0.1","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1664041983290,"modifiedTime":1669473753130,"lastModifiedBy":"EXOzwtPZWRz2Nge1"},"_id":"HdMVGkccCHVyrLAC"},{"name":"Abomination Generator","type":"script","scope":"global","author":"FyXPQ0Hozea7PQri","img":"icons/creatures/unholy/demon-fire-horned-winged-roar.webp","command":"game.bithirmod.macros.generateAbominationMacro();","folder":"keiBTL2WxCWPxGhJ","sort":200000,"ownership":{"default":0,"p1fVa688wzxO9LtK":3,"FyXPQ0Hozea7PQri":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Macro.mNAW5Mrw77dBBlZp"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"symbaroum","systemVersion":"4.0.1","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1663951452485,"modifiedTime":1669473753130,"lastModifiedBy":"EXOzwtPZWRz2Nge1"},"_id":"mNAW5Mrw77dBBlZp"},{"name":"Inspiration Roll","type":"script","scope":"global","author":"FyXPQ0Hozea7PQri","img":"modules/symbaroum-bithir-mod/assets/inspirationdice/inspirationicon.png","command":"game.bithirmod.macros.rollRollInspiration();","folder":"keiBTL2WxCWPxGhJ","sort":250000,"ownership":{"default":0,"EXOzwtPZWRz2Nge1":3,"FyXPQ0Hozea7PQri":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Macro.rDWIgUw0CJh7lfJG"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"symbaroum","systemVersion":"4.0.1","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1669417170925,"modifiedTime":1669473753130,"lastModifiedBy":"EXOzwtPZWRz2Nge1"},"_id":"rDWIgUw0CJh7lfJG"}],"cards":[],"playlists":[],"folders":[{"name":"EN - Bithir's Mods Abilities","type":"Item","folder":null,"description":"","sorting":"a","sort":0,"color":null,"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"symbaroum","systemVersion":"4.0.1","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1669473753138,"lastModifiedBy":"EXOzwtPZWRz2Nge1"},"_id":"65M9EShHVUETDuha"},{"name":"Bithir's mods","sorting":"a","folder":null,"type":"Macro","description":"","sort":0,"color":"#994d4d","flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"symbaroum","systemVersion":"4.0.1","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1669473753138,"lastModifiedBy":"EXOzwtPZWRz2Nge1"},"_id":"keiBTL2WxCWPxGhJ"}],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.bithirs-mods.dOFhm3orGiXLmGzT"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"symbaroum","systemVersion":"4.0.1","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1664211549078,"modifiedTime":1669474046964,"lastModifiedBy":"EXOzwtPZWRz2Nge1"},"sort":0,"_id":"EOLvmewkCU75UStz"}
